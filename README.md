### Whisper

Whisper is an app where privacy focused individuals can have ephemeral conversations that disappears almost like a whisper, right after they leave.

[Live Demo](https://blue-whisper.vercel.app/)



## How it works

1. Get some test tokens for Aleph Zero or Accurast
2. Install a wallet([Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/) is a good option)
4. Create or join a chatroom
5. Invite your friends (if you created)
6. Talk and talk
7. Delete chatroom and all messages

### Whisper

Whisper is an app where privacy focused individuals can have ephemeral conversations that disappears almost like a whisper, right after they leave.

## How it works

1. Get some test tokens for aleph zero and accurast
2. Install your talisman wallet
3. Connect your wallet
4. Create a chatroom
5. Invite your friends
6. Talk and talk
7. Destroy chatroom and all messages
